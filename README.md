# Car Window Control
Project comprised of programs that enable the integration of sensors and motors in a car for window control.

This repository contains one main program that enables the movement control of a window car based on safety standards. This main program allows the integration of two programs responsible for controlling different parts of the car. One of these programs controls the car sensors that detect the presence of an entity between the window glass and the edge of the window frame. The other program controls the window motors, in other words, instructs whether to operate or shutdown these components based on numerous conditions. Furthermore, there is a series of programs that test the validity of the the main program and two subsequent programs ensuring the flawless control of the movement of a car window.
