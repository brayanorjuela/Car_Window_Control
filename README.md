# Car-Window-Control
Programs that enable the integration of sensors and motors in a car for window control

This repository contains two main programs that when run in parallel enable
the movement control of a window car based on safety standards. One of the
programs controls the car sensors that detect the presence of an entity between
the window glass and the edge of the window frame. In the other program, the
window motors are controlled, in other words, are instructed to operate or shut
down based on different conditions. Furthermore, there is a series of programs
that test the validity of the two main programs and thus ensure the flawless
operation controlling the movement of a car window.
